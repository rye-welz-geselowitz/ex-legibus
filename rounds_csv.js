Hudson v. Garab et al,"Plaintiff led officers on a meth-fueled chase for more than a quarter of an hour. Following the  pursuit,  officers  used  force  to  place  Plaintiff  in  handcuffs.  That  force,  Plaintiff  alleges,  was  constitutionally infirm.","With  no  other  cases  offered,  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  identify  a  single  precedent  finding  a  Fourth Amendment violation under similar circumstances. As a result, Feller is entitled to qualified immunity.",2021,U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/indiana/inndce/1:2020cv00152/102736/59/
United States v. Weidner,"Dale A. Weidner is 28 years old. On February 16, 1988, drug task force officers executed a search warrant on his property.","Although the number of marijuana plants involved here was near the minimum covered by the Guideline range, because of the sophistication and duration of the manufacturing operation, and because the manufacture of marijuana was Mr. Weidner's principal, and often sole, source of income, the court deems a sentence of thirty-three months, the maximum allowed by the sentencing range, to be appropriate.",1988,U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/703/1350/1665966/

MOTORSPORTS HOLDINGS,"The respondent owns approximately 250 acres of land in Tamworth, on which it wishes to build a private, 3.1-mile automobile racetrack to be used as a “private driving instructional facility and motorsports country club.”","The respondent concedes that at least one of the named petitioners in this case owns abutting property.  The respondent also concedes, therefore, that at least one of the petitioners has standing.

CRAIG HARTLEY v. ELECTRIC INSURANCE CO.,"When an unidentified vehicle failed to yield the right of way to the petitioner, he was forced “to jam on his brakes,” which caused the straps holding a box saw in his truck to break and the saw to shift.",We conclude that the facts establish that the actions of the unidentified vehicle resulted in an accident that caused the injuries of the petitioner triggering coverage under the policy.,2007,New Hampshire Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/new-hampshire/supreme-court/2007/hartl003.html
Davis Estate,"Joseph Davis died, intestate and without known heirs, on February 17, 1948, in Donora, Washington County. An administrator was appointed and when the estate was called for audit William Davis, appellant, appeared and claimed the estate as decedent's half brother and sole heir.","[A]fter having heard all of the evidence and being convinced that appellant had completely failed to show his relationship to decedent, the court used sound discretion in refusing to consume more time by granting the petition.",1950,Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1950/365-pa-605-0.html
"Owsichek v. State, Guide Licensing","We are called upon to decide whether two statutes, AS 08.54.040(a)(7) & .195, comport with article VIII, section 3 of the Alaska Constitution. These statutes authorize the Guide Licensing and Control Board to grant hunting guides ""exclusive guide areas,"" geographic areas in which only the designated guide may lead hunts and from which all other guides are excluded.","For these reasons, we hold that AS 08.54.040(a)(7), AS 08.54.195, and the regulations of the Board permitting the assignment of exclusive guide areas are in contravention of article VIII, section 3 of the Alaska Constitution.",1988,Alaska Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/alaska/supreme-court/1988/s-1650-1.html
Patrick v. Municipality of Anchorage,A taxi driver was cited for driving with a suspended chauffeur's license. She asserted that she was not driving the cab on the night in question.  Because she had several other violations her license was revoked under the relevant municipal code. The taxi driver filed a timely appeal to contest the revocation of her license.,"Because there is substantial evidence supporting the finding that Patrick was driving the taxi on the night in question, because the process for appeal of a license revocation did not violate her right to due process, and because Patrick's due process rights  were  not  otherwise  violated,  we  AFFIRM  the  decision  of  the  superior  court  affirming the Commission’s decision in all respects.",2013,Alaska Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/alaska/supreme-court/2013/s-14360.html
Lingel v. Maudlin,"This is a suit in equity brought by Elizabeth L. Lingel, the divorced wife of defendant Nathan B. Maudlin wherein the plaintiff seeks an order awarding to her the custody of the minor children of the parties and the consequent modification of the order of an Idaho court which gave to the defendant the custody of said children subject only to plaintiff's right of visitation at reasonable times and places.",We think the court erred in providing that the plaintiff should have the actual custody and control of the minor children for two months in the summer and during the Christmas holidays in every other year. If the children are not to become a shuttlecock in the bitter game of competition over their custody and affection they must be assured of settled habits of life,1949,Oregon Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/supreme-court/1949/188-or-147-2.html
State v. Dempster,The defendant appeals from a conviction in Multnomah county of illegal possession of narcotics. He assigns as error only the denial of his motion to suppress as evidence the narcotics and a hypodermic syringe and needle taken from his person.,"We think that case does not support defendant's position. Assuming that defendant's initial detention was an unlawful arrest, nevertheless, defendant was lawfully arrested at the police station before he was searched.",1967,Oregon Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/supreme-court/1967/248-or-404-4.html
PEOPLE v. LITT,"In January, 1961, defendant told Dietrich, a bar and restaurant owner, that he heard he had a license revocation proceeding pending against him for sale to a minor and he should have told him of it because he could have ‘got it fixed’ so that he ‘wouldn't even have to go to court on it’; defendant introduced him to two ‘officers' saying they would ‘look into the matter.’ ","However, the proof reflects much more than the ‘con’ operation to which appellant admits; the inference is strong that defendant really intended to try to ‘fix,’ or to ‘fix,’ Bryman's case and solicited from him, and took, his $1,700 for that purpose. There is no doubt that two police officers were actively involved.",1963,"District Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 1, California.",https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1815625.html
Ransom vs. Radiology Specialists of the Northwest,"Plaintiff, the relator and petitioner in this orig-inal mandamus proceeding, filed a medical negligence action alleging that two radiologists employed by Radiology Specialists of the Northwest (defendant) were negligent in reading her imaging studies when they examined them in 2013.","We conclude that plaintiff’s questions about the radiologists’ current “knowledge and ability to read and interpret” plaintiff’s imaging studies are relevant, do not exceed the scope of discovery permitted by Oregon law, and do not interfere with the attorney-client privilege.",2018,Oregon Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/supreme-court/2018/s064309.html
Commonwealth vs. Bechtel,"Robert B. Bechtel, a student at Swarthmore College, was arrested on January 11, 1955, charged with the homicide of Francis Holmes Strozier, a fellow student. While awaiting indictment and trial he filed an application for a Commission under § 344 of The Mental Health Act of June 12, 1951",One of the two major reasons for the Mental Health Act was to protect society from those who are mentally ill and have criminal tendencies. Bechtel certainly comes squarely within these provisions of the Act.,1956,Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1956/384-pa-184-0.html
"PIZZA DI JOEY, LLC, ET AL.v.MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE","In October 2016, the Food Trucks sued the City in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.

"SCOTT BENJAMIN CARROLL, JR. v. STATE OF TENNESSEE","The Petitioner, along with several other individuals, was arrested at his wife‟s home for initiation of a process intended to manufacture methamphetamine.","We decline the Petitioner‟s invitation, and conclude that the State did not have an affirmative duty to preserve the components of the methamphetamine lab. As in Best, several of the components were items commonly associated with the manufacturing of methamphetamine, including used Pyrex dishes, mason jars and other bottles containing liquids, multiple funnels, a turkey baster, lighter fluid, and the device that Detective Taylor testified was frequently used in the “gassing off” stage of methamphetamine production",2015,Criminal Court for DeKalb County,https://cases.justia.com/tennessee/court-of-criminal-appeals/2015-m2015-00363-cca-r3-pc.pdf?ts=1449872308

Plaintiffs later learned that [*2]the infant plaintiff suffered a severe circumcision injury during the brit; that defendant Rachminov had cut off more than the infant plaintiff's foreskin","Barukh testified that on the date in question, he observed an unruly ""crowd"" at the religious services where the circumcision was performed, and that the ""crowd"" may have distracted Rachminov while he was performing the circumcision. He testified that he and his father attempted to hold the ""crowd"" back while Rachminov was performing the circumcision.

This case arises from an allergic reaction that Plaintiff Lindsay C. Anderson experienced after dining at one of Defendants’ restaurants.  Plaintiff has a severe dairy allergy that was first discovered when she was six months old. ","Though Dr. Banks opined that Plaintiff’s dining companions would have been “relatively sloppy

In Re Converse,"In 1998, Converse applied for permission to sit for the Nebraska bar examination. On June 29, 1998, Converse was notified by letter that the Commission had denied permission for him to take the July 1998 Nebraska bar examination because it had determined that Converse lacked the requisite moral character for admission upon examination to the Nebraska State Bar Association... One of the final issues addressed by the Commission in its hearing was that of a T-shirt Converse produced and marketed on which a nude caricature of Vickrey is shown sitting astride what appears to be a large hot dog.","Converse has exhibited a clear lack of self-restraint and lack of judgment, and our de novo review of the record leads us to independently conclude that Converse has exhibited such a pattern of acting in a hostile and disruptive manner as to render him unfit for the practice of law in Nebraska.",1999,Supreme Court of Nebraska,https://law.justia.com/cases/nebraska/supreme-court/1999/990001.html

Pierson v.

"United States v. One Book Called"" Ulysses""","I have read ""Ulysses"" once in its entirety and I have read those passages of which the government particularly complains several times. In fact, for many weeks, my spare time has been devoted to the consideration of the decision which my duty would require me to make in this matter.

""Ulysses"" is not an easy book to read or to understand. But there has been much written about it, and in order properly to approach the consideration of it it is advisable to read a number of other books which have now become its satellites. The study of ""Ulysses"" is, therefore, a heavy task.","I am quite aware that owing to some of its scenes ""Ulysses"" is a rather strong draught to ask some sensitive, though normal, persons to take. But my considered opinion, after long reflection, is that, whilst in many places the effect of ""Ulysses"" on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.

""Ulysses"" may, therefore, be admitted into the United States.",1933,US District Court for the Southern District of New York,https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/05-56274/0556274-2011-02-25.pdf?ts=1411056519&fbclid=IwAR1SZa5ZbROmn9IwinWJu-c9Jg-mU750-1B2pWwrV6j9Tnm07Q9zripkoBA

residence.  She was passing through Pierre when she was reported at 11:15 at night.  Therefore, exigent circumstances existed to immediately impound the animals for their safety.

Mann vs. Mack,"This case arose out of a lengthy neighborhood dispute. Plaintiffs, the Mann family, were nurturing an incipient rock and roll band in their garage, much to their neighbor's distress. The band, a group of three to four male teenagers, including the Manns' sixteen-year-old son, Darien, practiced at unscheduled times and often late into the night. The none-too-dulcet tones of their creative product, increased by an amplification system, made it difficult for neighbors to talk to one another without shouting. Evening television viewing in nearby houses often became impossible. The neighbors complained, to no avail. Acrimony developed and increased, particularly between the Manns and their next-door neighbors, the Macks. The Macks complained about the noise to the police on numerous occasions. As a result, the Manns' house became a regular stop on the local constabulary's beat.",We hold that the terms of Los Angeles Municipal Code section 116.01 are sufficiently certain to inform persons of ordinary intelligence of the nature of the conduct which is prohibited.,1984,"Court of Appeals of California, Second Appellate District, Division Five",https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/155/666.html
"Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.","Petitioner Masson, a psychoanalyst, became disillusioned with Freudian psychology while serving as Projects Director of the Sigmund Freud Archives, and was fired after advancing his own theories. Thereafter, respondent Malcolm, an author and contributor to respondent The New Yorker, a magazine, taped several interviews with Masson and wrote a lengthy article on his relationship with the Archives. One of Malcolm's narrative devices consists of enclosing lengthy passages attributed to Masson in quotation marks. Masson allegedly expressed alarm about several errors in those passages before the article was published.","Five of the six published passages differ materially in meaning from the tape recorded statements so as to create an issue of fact for a jury as to falsity. Whether the ""intellectual gigolo"" passage is defamatory is a question of California law, and to the extent that the Court of Appeals based its conclusion on the First Amendment, it was mistaken.",1991,US Supreme Court,https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/496/`
