Hudson v. Garab et al,"Plaintiff led officers on a meth-fueled chase for more than a quarter of an hour. Following the  pursuit,  officers  used  force  to  place  Plaintiff  in  handcuffs.  That  force,  Plaintiff  alleges,  was  constitutionally infirm.","With  no  other  cases  offered,  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  identify  a  single  precedent  finding  a  Fourth Amendment violation under similar circumstances. As a result, Feller is entitled to qualified immunity.",2021,U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/indiana/inndce/1:2020cv00152/102736/59/
United States v. Weidner,"Dale A. Weidner is 28 years old. On February 16, 1988, drug task force officers executed a search warrant on his property.","Although the number of marijuana plants involved here was near the minimum covered by the Guideline range, because of the sophistication and duration of the manufacturing operation, and because the manufacture of marijuana was Mr. Weidner's principal, and often sole, source of income, the court deems a sentence of thirty-three months, the maximum allowed by the sentencing range, to be appropriate.",1988,U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/703/1350/1665966/

An administrator was appointed and when the estate was called for audit William Davis, appellant, appeared and claimed the estate as decedent's half brother and sole heir.","[A]fter having heard all of the evidence and being convinced that appellant had completely failed to show his relationship to decedent, the court used sound discretion in refusing to consume more time by granting the petition.",1950,Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1950/365-pa-605-0.html
"Owsichek v. State, Guide Licensing","We are called upon to decide whether two statutes, AS 08.54.040(a)(7) & .195, comport with article VIII, section 3 of the Alaska Constitution. These statutes authorize the Guide Licensing and Control Board to grant hunting guides ""exclusive guide areas,"" geographic areas in which only the designated guide may lead hunts and from which all other guides are excluded.","For these reasons, we hold that AS 08.54.040(a)(7), AS 08.54.195, and the regulations of the Board permitting the assignment of exclusive guide areas are in contravention of article VIII, section 3 of the Alaska Constitution.",1988,Alaska Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/alaska/supreme-court/1988/s-1650-1.html
Patrick v. Municipality of Anchorage,A taxi driver was cited for driving with a suspended chauffeur's license. She asserted that she was not driving the cab on the night in question.  Because she had several other violations her license was revoked under the relevant municipal code. The taxi driver filed a timely appeal to contest the revocation of her license.,"Because there is substantial evidence supporting the finding that Patrick was driving the taxi on the night in question, because the process for appeal of a license revocation did not violate her right to due process, and because Patrick's due process rights  were  not  otherwise  violated,  we  AFFIRM  the  decision  of  the  superior  court  affirming the Commission’s decision in all respects.",2013,Alaska Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/alaska/supreme-court/2013/s-14360.html
Lingel v. Maudlin,"This is a suit in equity brought by Elizabeth L. Lingel, the divorced wife of defendant Nathan B. Maudlin wherein the plaintiff seeks an order awarding to her the custody of the minor children of the parties and the consequent modification of the order of an Idaho court which gave to the defendant the custody of said children subject only to plaintiff's right of visitation at reasonable times and places.",We think the court erred in providing that the plaintiff should have the actual custody and control of the minor children for two months in the summer and during the Christmas holidays in every other year. If the children are not to become a shuttlecock in the bitter game of competition over their custody and affection they must be assured of settled habits of life,1949,Oregon Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/supreme-court/1949/188-or-147-2.html
State v. Dempster,The defendant appeals from a conviction in Multnomah county of illegal possession of narcotics. He assigns as error only the denial of his motion to suppress as evidence the narcotics and a hypodermic syringe and needle taken from his person.,"We think that case does not support defendant's position. Assuming that defendant's initial detention was an unlawful arrest, nevertheless, defendant was lawfully arrested at the police station before he was searched.",1967,Oregon Supreme Court,https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/supreme-court/1967/248-or-404-4.html`
