"United States v. Weidner, 703 F. Supp. 1350 (N.D. Ind. 1988)","Dale A. Weidner is 28 years old. On February 16, 1988, drug task force officers executed a search warrant on his property.","Although the number of marijuana plants involved here was near the minimum covered by the Guideline range, because of the sophistication and duration of the manufacturing operation, and because the manufacture of marijuana was Mr. Weidner's principal, and often sole, source of income, the court deems a sentence of thirty-three months, the maximum allowed by the sentencing range, to be appropriate.",https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/703/1350/1665966/`
